Thick Prompting: Ekphrasis, Ritual, and the Design of Visual Worlds with Generative AI
Research Question:
How can the anthropological concept of "thick description" and the literary tradition of ekphrasis inform and shape a richer, more deliberate prompting practice for creating visual artifacts with generative AI?
Abstract:
The current discourse around AI prompting for image generation is often dominated by a narrow focus on representational fidelity and engineering efficiency. This paper argues for a more expansive, culturally-grounded understanding of prompting as a creative practice for art, personal expression, and entertainment. We position contemporary multimodal prompting within the ancient literary tradition of ekphrasis—the vivid description of a visual scene, often of an artwork—noting key parallels: the invocation of a whole world, the emphasis on process, and the creation of compelling artifacts.
To make this perspective operative, we draw on Clifford Geertz’s anthropological concept of "thick description," interpreting the prompt not as a mere instruction set but as a layered, heterogeneous stack (combining natural language, code, tags, and system prompts) whose execution resembles a cultural ritual. We synthesize these frameworks to propose "Thick Prompting," a method that treats prompting as a deliberate, interpretive act of world-building. The paper demonstrates how this theoretical lens illuminates emerging prompting techniques (such as JSON-structured prompts, meta-prompting, and iterative refinement) and provides a critical vocabulary to move beyond prosaic judgments of output. Through a design study focused on creating visual and interactive environments, we illustrate how Thick Prompting offers a navigable and interpretable approach to shaping the latent spaces of generative models, ultimately aiming to elevate prompting from a technical interface to a rich medium for cultural and artistic production.
