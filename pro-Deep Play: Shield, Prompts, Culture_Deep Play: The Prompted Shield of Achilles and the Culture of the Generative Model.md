  "high_impact_thesis": "By treating the Homeric description of the Shield of Achilles as a system of **deep play**—an intensified, symbolic event—we use **Prompt Differentials ($\\Delta\\Delta$)** as a form of **deep description** to excavate the latent symbolic systems, power hierarchies, and unwritten **protocols of refusal** that define the *culture* of the generative latent space. This single, thick case study redefines prompting as an act of interpretive theory.",

Define **Thick Prompting** as the **ritual text** that specifies intent and frame, making the human's *bet* (the interpretation) legible within the machine's probabilistic system. The protocol is the ritual's rulebook."

Argue that $\\Delta\\Delta$ does not measure output quality, but **symbolic sensitivity**—it measures what difference (micro-tweak) triggers a disproportionate symbolic change (the model’s *anxiety*). This is the equivalent of analyzing the high-stakes bet in the cockfight to reveal the structural pressure points."

Focus analysis on the **Refusal Zones**—the parts of the Shield that cannot be compiled or that collapse into genericism. The **Protocol of Refusal** is the model’s ideology made manifest. Use $\\Delta\\Delta$ to compare the 'City at Peace' and 'City at War' scenes to expose the system's explicit and implicit biases (e.g., ethical filters, training data's lack of true historical specificity)."

The Prompted Shield provides the deepest available insights into the generative model's *culture*: its power structures (co-authorship), its **simulacral materiality**, and its symbolic taboos. The paper's contribution is a formal methodology for protocol auditing by the humanities."
