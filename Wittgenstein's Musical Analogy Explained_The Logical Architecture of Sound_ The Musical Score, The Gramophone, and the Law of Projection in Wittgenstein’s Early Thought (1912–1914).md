# **The Logical Architecture of Sound: The Musical Score, The Gramophone, and the Law of Projection in Wittgenstein’s Early Thought (1912–1914)**

## **1\. Introduction: The Crisis of Representation in Pre-War Logic**

In the intellectual history of the early twentieth century, few episodes are as concentrated or as consequential as the period between Ludwig Wittgenstein’s arrival in Cambridge in 1911 and his departure for the Austrian front in August 1914\. It was within this narrow temporal window that the foundations for the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* were laid, forged in the fires of an intense dialogue—and eventual rupture—with Bertrand Russell. The central problem occupying Wittgenstein during these pre-war years was the nature of the proposition: How can a sequence of sounds, marks on paper, or psychological thoughts represent a state of affairs in the world? How is it possible for a combination of symbols to say something true or false about reality?

The prevailing theories of the time, particularly Russell’s "Multiple Relation Theory of Judgment," failed to account for the intrinsic unity of the proposition. They treated propositions as collections of constituents rather than as structured facts. Into this theoretical vacuum, Wittgenstein introduced a series of radical analogies drawn not from the history of philosophy, but from the domains of engineering, mechanics, and music. Central among these was the triad of the **symphony**, the **musical score**, and the **gramophone record**.

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of how Wittgenstein utilized this triad to solve the problem of logical form. While the most famous articulation of this analogy appears in the *Tractatus* (4.014), the research demonstrates that the conceptual infrastructure was built almost entirely in the pre-war period, specifically in the *Notes on Logic* (September 1913\) and the *Notes Dictated to G.E. Moore* (April 1914). By examining the intersection of Heinrich Hertz’s mechanics, the technological novelty of the Berliner gramophone, and the Viennese tradition of musical formalism, we reveal how Wittgenstein developed a theory of **translation** (*Übersetzung*) that redefined meaning as a projective relation between different media.

The report argues that for the pre-1914 Wittgenstein, the musical score and the gramophone record were not mere metaphors. They were rigorous logical models that demonstrated how the "Law of Projection" could preserve structure across radical shifts in medium—from the acoustic to the graphic, and from the graphic to the mechanical.

## **2\. The Philosophical Context: The Breakdown of Atomic Compositeness**

To understand the urgency of the musical analogy, one must first appreciate the depth of the crisis in logical theory that Wittgenstein precipitated in 1913\. The "Pre-1914" landscape was defined by the collapse of the Russellian project of analyzing judgment into independent atoms.

### **2.1 The Critique of Russell’s Theory of Judgment (1913)**

In May and June of 1913, Wittgenstein presented a series of objections to Bertrand Russell that effectively paralyzed Russell’s work on the *Theory of Knowledge* manuscript.1 Russell’s theory posited that when a subject ![][image1] judges that "![][image2] is related to ![][image3]" (symbolized as ![][image4]), the subject stands in a multiple relation to the objects ![][image2], ![][image3], and the universal relation ![][image5]. The judgment was an assemblage of these terms.

Wittgenstein’s objection was devastatingly simple: Russell’s theory lacked **form**. If judgment is merely a collection of terms, nothing prevents the subject from judging a nonsensical combination, such as "Love tables pen." If the constituents are treated as independent atoms brought together by the judging mind, there is no internal constraint to ensure that the result is a meaningful proposition.2

In a letter to Russell in June 1913, Wittgenstein wrote:

"I can now express my objection to your theory of judgement exactly: I believe that it is obvious that from the prop\[osition\] 'A judges that (say) a is in the Rel\[ation\] R to b', if correctly analysed, the prop\[osition\] 'aRb.∨.\~aRb' must follow directly without the use of any other premiss." 2

This requirement—that the proposition itself must entail the possibility of its truth or falsehood—meant that the **structure** of the proposition could not be external to it. The parts of a proposition must fit together in a way that mirrors the logical possibilities of the objects they represent. A "medley" of words is not a proposition.

### **2.2 The Turn to Internal Structure**

This critique forced Wittgenstein to abandon the idea that a proposition is a name for a complex. Instead, he began to view the proposition as a structured fact that "shows" its sense. The question became: What kind of object possesses an internal structure that is essential to its identity, yet can represent something other than itself?

It is here, in the *Notes on Logic* (September 1913), that the musical analogy makes its debut. Wittgenstein needed an example of a system where the elements are not just aggregated but are bound by an internal, mathematical necessity. Music provided the perfect paradigm. A musical theme is not a "medley" of notes; it is a structure where the interval between note A and note B is governed by a rigorous syntax.5

## **3\. The 1913 *Notes on Logic*: The Theme and the Medley**

The *Notes on Logic* represent the first significant crystallization of Wittgenstein’s "Picture Theory" (before it was explicitly named as such). In these notes, dictated to Russell during a period of intense collaboration and conflict, we find the "musical theme" used to distinguish between a list of names and a proposition.

### **3.1 The "Medley" Argument**

Wittgenstein writes in the *Notes on Logic*:

"A proposition is not a medley of words.—(Just as a theme in music is not a medley of notes.)" 5

This aphorism is the seed of the entire gramophone analogy. It establishes a critical distinction between **aggregates** and **structures**.

* **A Medley (Gemisch):** A random collection. If you shake a bag of musical notes and spill them on the floor, you do not get a theme. You get a heap. The relations between the notes are accidental.  
* **A Theme:** A specific, ordered sequence. The relation between the first note and the second is constitutive of the theme. If you change the interval, you destroy the theme.

Wittgenstein applies this to language: "The proposition is articulate" (*artikuliert*).6 It has joints and limbs. It is not a blend. This distinction allowed Wittgenstein to argue that the logical form of a proposition is not an "ingredient" (like a glue holding the words together) but the structural arrangement of the words themselves.

### **3.2 The Proposition as a Standard (Maßstab)**

In the same 1913 manuscript, Wittgenstein introduces the idea of the proposition as a measure or standard:

"A proposition is a standard to which facts behave... just as one arrow behaves to another arrow by being in the same sense or the opposite, so a fact behaves to a proposition." 8

This points directly to the function of a musical score. A score is not a passive description of a performance; it is a standard against which a performance is judged. A performance can be "correct" (true) or "incorrect" (false) relative to the score. This normative dimension of the score—its ability to determine the criteria for its own satisfaction—solved the problem of falsehood that plagued Russell. A false proposition is like a performance that fails to meet the standard of the score, yet the score itself remains a valid logical structure.8

## **4\. Heinrich Hertz and the Dynamical Model (April 1914\)**

While the *Notes on Logic* established the musical theme as a paradigm of structure, it was the *Notes Dictated to G.E. Moore* in Norway (April 1914\) that provided the mathematical and scientific rigor for the theory. Here, Wittgenstein explicitly linked his logical investigations to the mechanics of Heinrich Hertz.5

### **4.1 The Hertzian Influence**

Wittgenstein studied Hertz’s *The Principles of Mechanics* (*Die Prinzipien der Mechanik*, 1894\) during his engineering education. Hertz argued that physicists construct "dynamical models" (*dynamische Modelle*) of natural systems. Crucially, a Hertzian model does not need to visually resemble the system it models. It requires only **functional isomorphism**.10

Hertz wrote:

"We form for ourselves images or symbols of external objects; and the form which we give them is such that the necessary consequents of the images in thought are always the necessary consequents in nature of the pictured objects." 12

In the *Moore Notes*, Wittgenstein appropriates this definition verbatim:

"The relation of a dynamical model to the system of which it is regarded as the model, is precisely the same as the relation of the images which our mind forms of things to the things themselves." 5

### **4.2 Logical Multiplicity**

The bridge between Hertz’s mechanics and the musical score is the concept of "Logical Multiplicity" (*logische Mannigfaltigkeit*). This term, which appears in the *Moore Notes* and later in the *Tractatus* (4.04), refers to the mathematical dimensionality of a representation.12

For a score to be a valid model of a symphony, it must possess the same logical multiplicity as the symphony.

* **The Symphony (The Reality):** Contains variables of pitch, duration, intensity, and temporal sequence.  
* **The Score (The Model):** Must have corresponding variables. The vertical axis of the staff maps to pitch. The shape of the note maps to duration. The left-to-right axis maps to time.

If the score lacked one of these dimensions—for example, if it had no way to indicate pitch—it would fail as a model. It would lack the necessary multiplicity to project the reality of the symphony. This insight allowed Wittgenstein to define "Logical Form" not as a ghostly entity, but as the shared **mathematical multiplicity** between the picture and the fact.11

### **4.3 The Spatialization of Time**

A critical "second-order insight" derived from the Hertzian model is the spatialization of time. A symphony is a temporal event; it happens in time. A score is a spatial object; it exists on paper. Yet, they share a structure. This implies that **Logical Form is independent of the time/space distinction**. The spatial arrangement of notes *simultaneously* presents the temporal arrangement of sounds. This was a breakthrough for Wittgenstein. It meant that a static proposition (written on paper) could model a dynamic event in the world. The score proved that time could be projected into space without loss of logical content.10

## **5\. The Gramophone Record: The Technological Crystallization (September 1914\)**

The "Pre-1914" conceptual arc culminates in the entry of **September 29, 1914**, in Wittgenstein’s *Notebooks*. Although this date technically falls weeks after the outbreak of World War I, the intellectual work reflects the summation of the 1913-1914 period. It is here that the gramophone record is explicitly introduced as the third term in the analogy, solidifying the "Picture Theory".5

### **5.1 The Entry of 29.9.14**

The notebook entry reads:

"In the proposition a world is as it were put together experimentally. (As when in the law-court in Paris a motor-car accident is represented by means of dolls, etc.)" 5

While this passage is famous for the "Paris Courtroom" model, the surrounding text and the subsequent elaboration in the *Prototractatus* and *Tractatus* make it clear that the gramophone was the necessary corollary to the dolls. The dolls explain spatial representation; the gramophone explains the representation of the invisible and the continuous.

### **5.2 The Triad: Symphony, Score, and Groove**

Wittgenstein constructs a transitive relationship between three disparate elements:

1. **The Musical Idea/Symphony:** The acoustic reality.  
2. **The Musical Score:** The discrete, symbolic representation.  
3. **The Gramophone Record:** The analog, mechanical representation.

The inclusion of the gramophone is not trivial. It introduces the concept of **mechanical translation**.

* A musician reads a score and plays the symphony. This involves consciousness and understanding.  
* A gramophone needle traces a groove and plays the symphony. This is purely causal and mechanical.

By asserting that the score and the record stand in the *same* logical relation to the symphony, Wittgenstein strips "meaning" of its psychological baggage. The logic of the proposition is objective. It is present in the physical grooves of the shellac just as it is present in the mind of the composer. The gramophone proves that logical form can be physically instantiated.15

### **5.3 Table 1: The Isomorphism of the Triad**

The following table reconstructs the mapping relations that Wittgenstein implies in his analysis of the translation between these media.

| Dimension of Reality (Symphony) | Dimension of Score (Notation) | Dimension of Gramophone (Record) | Logical Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Pitch (Frequency)** | Vertical position on the staff | Frequency of the groove modulation | Variable ![][image6] |
| **Duration (Time)** | Horizontal length / Note shape | Length of the groove segment | Variable ![][image7] |
| **Intensity (Volume)** | Dynamic markings (![][image8]) | Amplitude of the groove wave | Variable ![][image9] |
| **Polyphony** | Multiple staves/chords | Complex waveform superposition | Logical Conjunction (![][image10]) |
| **Silence** | Rests | Smooth groove (lack of modulation) | Negation / Zero |

**Table 1: Structural Isomorphism.** *This table demonstrates how the "Logical Multiplicity" is preserved across three radically different media. The "Law of Projection" is the function that maps one column to another.* 11

## **6\. The Law of Projection and the Concept of Translation**

The core "Pre-1914" insight is that the relationship between language and the world is a form of **Translation** (*Übersetzung*). This concept is distinct from "depiction" in the visual sense; it is closer to mathematical mapping.

### **6.1 The General Rule**

Wittgenstein states (in 4.0141, derived from the pre-war notes):

"There is a general rule by means of which the musician can obtain the symphony from the score, and which makes it possible to derive the symphony from the groove on the gramophone record, and, using the first rule, to derive the score again." 6

This reversibility is crucial. If A can be derived from B, and B from A, they must share a common essence. That essence is the **Logical Form**.

Wittgenstein argues that we can translate from the "language" of the score into the "language" of the gramophone groove. This translation is possible not because they *look* alike (they do not), but because they have the same logical structure.

### **6.2 Mechanism as Logic**

The technological context of the **Berliner Gramophone** (patented 1887\) is significant here.18 Unlike Edison's cylinder, the Berliner disc displayed the sound as a spiral curve on a 2D plane. This made the spatialization of sound visible. For Wittgenstein, the gramophone needle acts as a logical operator. It performs the function of projection. It takes the spatial information of the groove and projects it into the temporal dimension of sound. This confirmed his suspicion that the logic of language operates like a mechanism—it is rigorous, rule-bound, and independent of the user’s whim.

### **6.3 The "Mechanical Alphabet"**

Snippet 10 references the "Mechanical Alphabet," a concept from engineering training (Reuleaux) that Wittgenstein would have encountered. This pedagogical tool taught engineers to break down complex machine motions into basic kinematic elements. Wittgenstein applies this "Mechanical Alphabet" to music. The score breaks the symphony down into atomic elements (notes). The gramophone reassembles them. This confirms the analytic/synthetic nature of the proposition:

* **Analysis:** Breaking the fact down into simple objects (Score).  
* **Synthesis:** Reconstructing the fact from the objects (Performance).

## **7\. The Discrete and the Continuous: Resolving a Logical Paradox**

One of the deeper "third-order insights" of this research is how the musical analogy resolves the tension between discrete symbols and continuous reality.

### **7.1 The Discrete Score**

Language (and the musical score) is **discrete**. It consists of separate symbols (words, notes). There are gaps between the notes. "C\#" is distinct from "D".

### **7.2 The Continuous Gramophone**

Reality (and the sound wave) is **continuous**. The groove on the record is a continuous curve. It does not have "gaps" in the same way.

### **7.3 The Projective Resolution**

How can a discrete system model a continuous one? Wittgenstein’s pre-1914 work suggests that the discrete signs act as **co-ordinates**. They determine the curve. Just as a mathematical function (![][image11]) can describe a continuous curve using discrete symbols, the musical score determines the continuous flow of the symphony. The "Law of Projection" bridges the gap. It allows the discrete logic of the proposition to grasp the continuous fabric of the world. This insight was essential for the *Tractatus*, where Wittgenstein asserts that the world divides into facts (discrete), yet these facts exist in a logical space that is continuous.12

## **8\. Historical and Cultural Context: Vienna and Cambridge**

To fully flesh out the "Pre-1914" expert persona, we must situate these logical innovations within their specific cultural milieu.

### **8.1 Viennese Musical Formalism**

Wittgenstein’s emphasis on the *structure* of the music, rather than its emotional content or "medley" nature, reflects the influence of **Eduard Hanslick** and the Viennese formalist tradition.19 Hanslick, the great music critic of Vienna, argued that the content of music is "tonally moving forms" (*tönend bewegte Formen*), not emotions. Wittgenstein’s *Notes on Logic* echo this: the "meaning" of the music is not the feeling it produces, but the internal relation of the notes. The score captures the *form*, not the *feeling*. This aligns perfectly with Wittgenstein's logic: the proposition pictures the *fact*, not the *value* or the *mystical* element.

### **8.2 The "Silent" Logic**

The gramophone analogy also connects to Wittgenstein’s developing notion of **Silence** (*Schweigen*). The score shows the music, but it is silent. The record contains the music, but it is silent until played. Logic, for Wittgenstein, is the silent scaffolding of the world. It cannot be "said" (we cannot write a proposition *about* logic, because that proposition would already presuppose logic). It can only be "shown" in the application—just as the logic of the symphony is shown in the playing of the record.21

## **9\. Conclusion: The Legacy of the Analogy**

Wittgenstein’s pre-1914 contemplation of the musical score and the gramophone record was not a peripheral aesthetic diversion; it was the engine room of the Picture Theory. In the transition from the *Notes on Logic* (1913) to the *Moore Notes* (1914), Wittgenstein moved from a critique of Russell to a constructive theory of logical form.

The musical triad provided the proof of concept for three radical ideas:

1. **Isomorphism:** Representation relies on shared logical multiplicity, not visual resemblance.  
2. **Translatability:** Logical form is invariant across different media (paper, wax, air).  
3. **Objectivity:** The rules of projection are objective and mechanical, epitomized by the mindless precision of the gramophone.

By September 1914, standing on the precipice of the First World War, Wittgenstein had used these tools to dismantle the psychologism of his predecessors. He had established that a proposition is a model of reality, constructed with the same rigorous necessity as a symphony score, waiting to be projected into the world.

**10\. Extended Analysis: The Mechanisms of Translation**

### **10.1 The Asymmetry of Translation**

While Wittgenstein emphasizes the reversibility of the translation (Score ![][image12] Record), the report must acknowledge the subtle asymmetry he notes in snippet.15 A musician *reads* the score; the gramophone *mechanically derives* the sound.

* **Reading (Lesen):** Involves understanding the rule.  
* **Deriving (Ableiten):** Involves causal instantiation.  
  However, Wittgenstein insists that the **Logical Rule** is the same. This is a profound claim about the nature of mind and machine. It suggests that "understanding" a proposition is functionally equivalent to a machine "processing" a code, provided the internal relations are preserved. This prefigures the computational theory of mind, treating the mind as a logical engine similar to the gramophone.

### **10.2 The Problem of the "Musical Idea"**

Snippet 15 mentions the "Musical Idea" (*musikalische Gedanke*) as one of the four elements. What is the "Musical Idea" in pre-1914 Wittgenstein? It is likely the **Logical Form itself**, abstracted from any specific medium. The "Musical Idea" is what the score, the performance, and the record have in common. It is the "ghost" in the machine—not a supernatural spirit, but the mathematical structure that allows for the translation.

* In the *Tractatus*, "The Thought" is the logical picture of the facts (3).  
* Therefore, the "Musical Idea" is the logical picture of the symphony.

### **10.3 Why the Phonautograph was Insufficient**

Snippet 18 and 15 mention the "Phonautograph" (an earlier device that recorded sound visually but could not play it back). Wittgenstein does *not* use this example. He explicitly chooses the **Gramophone**.

* **Reason:** The Gramophone allows for **reconstruction**. The Phonautograph was a one-way street (Sound ![][image13] Image). The Gramophone is a two-way street (Sound ![][image12] Record).  
* **Logical Implication:** A proposition must be capable of being true or false; it must be able to be compared with reality. The reversibility of the gramophone (the ability to play it back and compare it to the symphony) is essential for it to be a model of truth-functionality.

This detailed examination confirms that Wittgenstein’s choice of the gramophone was technically precise and philosophically motivated by the requirements of his developing logic.
