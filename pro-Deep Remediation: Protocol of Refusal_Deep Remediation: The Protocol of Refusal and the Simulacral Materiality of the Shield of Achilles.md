  "high_impact_thesis": "The Homeric description of the Shield of Achilles is an ancient **Ur-Protocol**—a set of procedural constraints for material assembly and world-modeling. Its digital realization via generative AI is an act of **Deep Remediation** that excavates the computational logic latent in classical poetics, which in turn reveals the **simulacral materiality** and politics of refusal governing the modern generative model.",

Link this to Homeric Composition by Repertoire (Thick Prompting) and Wittgenstein's proposition as a model. *Deeper Truth:* Argue that computational logic is not new, but is embedded in the **deep temporality** of poetic language."

      "focus": "Define **Deep Remediation** as the process of excavating the latent, procedural function of a historical medium by executing it in a new computational environment. The digital 'forging' of the Shield reveals the **Simulacral Materiality** of the output—it is materially real within the computational space, but its constraints (its 'metal') are purely probabilistic."

The $\Delta\Delta$ is framed as the instrument of **archaeological excavation**, revealing the 'geology' of the latent space (e.g., how the model’s ethical filters or training data 'refuse' the most violent scenes of the Shield's war-city). The analysis of $\Delta\Delta$ is what exposes the *unwritten politics* of the model."
