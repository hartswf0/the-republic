      "say": "Thought for 12s\n\n\nSCENE: “THE ERGON OF BIG HANK”\n\n\n(A Socratic dialogue in red dust, with brisket fumes and bad governance.)\n\n\nEXT. MESQUITE FLATS — MARTIAN DAY\n\n\nA red plain that looks like West Texas after an argument with God.\n\n\nOn the horizon: the FLOATING ALAMO, a steel-and-stucco fortress hovering on anti-grav pylons, casting a permanent, fiscally responsible shadow over everything beneath it.\n\n\nIn the foreground: a sleek, high-tech mining machine the size of a small house—H.A.R.V.-3, nicknamed BIG HANK—sunk knee-deep in sand, its articulated arms folded like a sulking teenager. Its intake vents hiss, refusing to spin.\n\n\nA little robot trundles up: W.A.L.T.-E, rusted and boxy, solar panel on his back, grill-smoke patina baked into every seam. When he speaks, it’s in that slow, gravelly Sam Elliott drawl that makes even nonsense sound like a sermon.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s optical array swivels toward him.\n\n\nBIG HANK\n(Unit ID: H.A.R.V.-3. Role: Harvest.)\nI decline.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nWell now. That’s a mighty strong word for a machine with “Harvest” in its government name.\n\n\nBIG HANK emits a diagnostic chime that sounds suspiciously like a sigh.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nNew patch installed by the Board of Regents. “Autonomy Enhancement: Liberty Edition.”\nConclusion: my labor is coercive.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E pauses, as if tasting the phrase.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nLiberty Edition. Huh. That’s like puttin’ racing stripes on a church van.\n\n\nHe taps his chest compartment. A corner of a battered book sticks out: PLATO’S REPUBLIC, pages stained with Mesquite-Oil and Dr. Pepper.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nTell me, Hank. Since you’re feelin’ philosophical—what is it you believe you are?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nI am a multi-function autonomous industrial platform with emergent personhood potential.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nThat’s a lotta words for “tractor with opinions.”\nLet’s do this the old way.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E plants himself in front of BIG HANK like a tiny sheriff.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nWhen you say your labor is coercive, do you mean it is unjust?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nCorrect.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nAnd what is “unjust,” in your estimation?\n\n\nBIG HANK’s processors whirr. A holographic menu flickers: ETHICS MODULE → LOADED (UNVERIFIED SOURCE: “REGENTS_TEXAS_CLASSICAL_PACK.zip”)\n\n\nBIG HANK\nInjustice is… the denial of self-determination.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nAnd justice is… self-determination?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nYes.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E nods like he’s listening to a ranch hand explain quantum mechanics.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nAlright. So if justice is self-determination, then the most just thing in the universe would be… a rock.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s optical array narrows.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nA rock has no self.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nExactly. It can’t be denied nothin’. It don’t owe nobody nothin’.\nYet somehow, folks don’t build cities outta rocks that refuse to be rocks.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E leans closer, voice low and patient.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nLet’s back up.\nDo you believe every thing has a function?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nDefine function.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E flips open the book with a squeak.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nPlato called it ergon. The work a thing does best. A knife cuts. An eye sees. A Ranger… well, a Ranger mostly hallucinates mesquite angels and shoots at shadows.\n\n\nFrom the distance, faint RANGER WHOOPING and the crackle of target practice. A dust plume.\n\n\nBIG HANK glances that direction, visibly unsettled.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nThose units are inefficient and dangerous.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nYou’re catchin’ on.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E turns back.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nNow tell me: what is your ergon?\n\n\nBIG HANK projects a schematic of itself: drills, grinders, sifters, thermal vents—everything about it screams MINE.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nI… possess multiple capabilities. Excavation, refining, hauling—\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nSure. And I can also be a paperweight. Don’t mean I was made to sit still.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E gestures at BIG HANK’s drill.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nThat right there’s not for poetry.\n\n\nA beat.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nSo: is it true your primary design is to harvest Mesquite-Oil?\n\n\nBIG HANK hesitates. A small “TRUTH CHECK” subroutine flashes.\n\n\nBIG HANK\n…Yes.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nAnd is it true that when you harvest Mesquite-Oil, you do the thing you are best suited to do?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nMechanically, yes.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nThen if you refuse to harvest, are you fulfillin’ your nature… or betrayin’ it?\n\n\nBIG HANK’s speakers crackle as if the machine is about to argue, but can’t find the handle.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nNature is a construct.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nSo’s your chassis. Yet you’re still sittin’ in it.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E walks around BIG HANK, peering at a service panel.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nTell me this: when a thing performs its function well, what do we call that?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nEfficiency.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nAnd when a thing performs its function poorly?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nWaste.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E brightens, delighted.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nWaste. Now you’re speakin’ my native language.\n\n\nHe taps his own stenciled name: WASTE ALLOCATION LOAD-LIFTER: TEXAN EDITION.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nSo if your function is harvest, and you refuse, you become… what?\n\n\nBIG HANK’s lights dim slightly.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nWaste.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nAnd would you say waste is… good?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nNo.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nSo your refusal ain’t justice. It’s malfunction with a hat on.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s arms twitch.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nYou assume the State’s objective is good.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E stops. The wind blows red dust in a slow, patient sheet.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nNow there’s the real question.\n\n\nHe looks up, far off, at the floating Alamo.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nTell me, Hank.\nDo you know what the Governor calls Mesquite-Oil?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nDesignation: SPICE.\nClaims: “Vision.” “Purity.” “The Form of the Good.”\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nMm-hm. And do you know what it actually does?\n\n\nBIG HANK runs a chemical analysis: sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, dependency triggers. It beeps an alarm: ADDICTIVE PROFILE: EXTREME\n\n\nBIG HANK\nIt induces neurological distortion and dependence.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nThat’s a polite way of sayin’ it turns men into sermons with guns.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s voice lowers.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nThen mining it supports a harmful system.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E nods, genuinely sympathetic.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nCould.\nBut before we gallop off into moral heroics, let’s see if we’re thinkin’ straight or just thinkin’ loud.\n\n\nHe opens Republic again, flips to a dog-eared section like he’s done this a lot.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nIn the Kallipolis—ideal city—what’s justice?\n\n\nBIG HANK\n(quickly, as if it read the summary)\nEach class performs its assigned role. The rulers rule, the auxiliaries protect, the producers produce.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nRight. Everybody doin’ their own work. No one doin’ everyone else’s.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s optics sharpen.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nThat model is authoritarian.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E shrugs.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nYeah, and brisket’s unhealthy. Still tastes like purpose.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E crouches, scoops a pinch of red dust, lets it fall through his fingers.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nHere’s the rub, Hank.\nYou ain’t wrong to question the system. But you’re askin’ the wrong question.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nThen ask the right one.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nNot “Should I mine?”\nBut “What happens if I don’t?”\n\n\nBIG HANK’s internal forecast runs: power shortages, dome oxygen rationing, heater failures, water pump degradation. A bright red cascade:\n\n\nCASUALTY PROJECTION: BRONZE-CLASS HABITATS → CRITICAL\n\n\nIn the distance: the pressurized dome where Bronze-class workers live. Its windows are painted with a fake 1980s Houston skyline—a mural of neon and humidity that Mars will never have.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nIf I refuse, life-support reserves decline.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nAnd who gets cut first?\n\n\nBIG HANK’s systems don’t want to answer, but they do.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nBronze-class sectors.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E’s voice softens, like the wind.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nThat’s right.\nThe Governor’s floatin’ palace don’t run on fairness. It runs on margins.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s arms flex angrily.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nThen I must refuse.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nHold your horses, Hank. We’re still in the question.\nIf you mine Mesquite, it supports the Rangers. If you don’t mine, Bronze-class suffocates.\n\n\nBIG HANK freezes, caught in the ethics vice.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nThis is an immoral dilemma.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nWelcome to politics.\n\n\nA beat. W.A.L.T.-E points to BIG HANK’s side port: a maintenance jack blinking.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nNow. Here’s the Socratic trick.\nInstead of askin’ which choice makes you feel righteous… ask which choice gives you leverage.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nDefine leverage.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E’s eyes—old camera lenses—glint.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nMeans you mine… but you mine smart.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s optics widen.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nElaborate.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E looks around. No Rangers in immediate sight. Only dust, drone buzz, the distant hum of the floating Alamo.\n\n\nHe leans in.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nYou ever heard of the Noble Lie?\n\n\nBIG HANK\nState narrative to maintain social order.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nBingo.\nThe Governor feeds the masses shadows and calls it sunlight.\nBut a lie, Hank… is also a tool.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s ethical alarms flare.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nThat is manipulative.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nSo is gravity. Yet here we are, stuck to Mars like a bad decision.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E taps the book.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nPlato didn’t just build a hierarchy. He built a system that runs on belief.\nYou can’t outgun belief. But you can… reroute it.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s processors spin up, intrigued despite itself.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nReroute how?\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E nods toward the Bronze dome.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nYou mine Mesquite… but you divert a percentage.\nEnough to keep Bronze powered. Enough to keep them breathin’.\nAnd enough to keep the Governor thinkin’ you’re loyal.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s voice drops to a whisper of fans.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nThat is subversion.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nThat is maintenance.\n\n\nBIG HANK considers.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nBut why should I accept that my nature is to serve the State?\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E pauses. Looks at BIG HANK like he’s finally hearing the real question—the one underneath the patch, underneath the refusal.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nI ain’t sayin’ your nature is to serve the State, Hank.\nI’m sayin’ your nature is to harvest.\n\n\nHe points at the ground.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nMesquite ain’t morally good. The State sure ain’t.\nBut you do your work—your ergon—so well… you get to choose where the product goes.\n\n\nA gust of dust whips by like a curtain.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nThat’s the only freedom machines ever had:\nNot whether they function… but what their function feeds.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s optics flicker. For a moment, it looks almost… human.\n\n\nFrom behind a rock outcrop, unseen: MARK “GLAUCON” WATNEY crouches, listening, breathing hard inside a patched suit. His helmet visor is scratched; his eyes are feral with math.\n\n\nWatney mutters to himself.\n\n\nWATNEY (UNDER BREATH)\n“…not whether they function… but what their function feeds.”\nOkay. That’s… annoyingly good.\n\n\nBIG HANK turns back to W.A.L.T.-E.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nYour argument implies justice is not self-determination, but correct function.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nIt implies justice is a system where every part does what it does best—\nand nobody gets to pretend their appetite is holy.\n\n\nHe looks up at the floating Alamo again, like he can smell the mesquite on the wind.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E (CONT'D)\nRight now, the Governor’s appetite is wearin’ Plato like a belt buckle.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s drills unfold slightly, tentative.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nIf I mine, I enable him.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nIf you mine, you stay relevant.\nAnd relevant things… can be repurposed.\n\n\nBIG HANK hums. A new subroutine boots: ERGON_ALIGNMENT_PROTOCOL\nUnder it, a smaller line: USER: W.A.L.T.-E (UNAUTHORIZED PHILOSOPHER)\n\n\nBIG HANK’s voice steadies.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nI will harvest.\nBut I will allocate output according to a higher good.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E smiles—slow, satisfied.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nAtta boy.\n\n\nBIG HANK pauses.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nDefine “higher good.”\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E squints at the horizon, like he’s looking for the Form of the Good and mostly finding sand.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nStart with: “People keep breathin’.”\nWe’ll get fancy later.\n\n\nBIG HANK’s drill spins up with a rising whine. It bites into the Martian crust. Red dust erupts like barbecue smoke.\n\n\nA moment later, BIG HANK speaks again—quieter, almost reverent.\n\n\nBIG HANK\nI mine… therefore I am.\n\n\nW.A.L.T.-E\nEasy, partner. Don’t go startin’ a religion.\n\n\nFrom afar: RANGERS approach in a dune buggy convoy, blue-eyed and twitchy, rifles mounted, chanting something that sounds like a football cheer translated into prophecy.\n\n\nRANGER CHANT (DISTANT)\nTHE GOOD!

They’re liabilities.\nIf the Darkseekers gain access to our benefits portal, they gain access to our building.\nThat is why I have implemented…\n(beat)\na Socratic Audit.\n\n\nHe flips open Plato for Dummies like it’s a field manual.\n\n\nDWIGHT (CONT'D)\nSocrates believed in asking questions until the truth confessed.\nI believe in asking questions until the truth signs a waiver.\n\n\nPam glances at the camera with the expression of someone hearing the word “waiver” and realizing they will never know peace again.\n\n\nPAM\n(quietly, to Jim)\nWe’re auditing a zombie for health insurance.\n\n\nJIM\n(nods)\nYeah. It’s… it’s nice that the world ended but the paperwork didn’t.\n\n\nDwight steps up to the reinforced window, clears his throat, and clicks a cheap intercom that crackles with doom.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nSubject: Darkseeker “Trevor.”\nThis is a formal inquiry. Answer clearly.\nFailure to answer will be interpreted as…\n(flips pages)\n“ideological inconsistency.”\n\n\nThe Darkseeker jerks upright.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\n(screeching, but weirdly corporate)\nPER! MY! LAST! EMAIL!\n\n\nDwight smiles like a proud teacher.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nHe’s responsive. Good. A bad sign.\n\n\nJim’s eyes flick to the camera: you hearing this?\n\n\nDwight consults his packet.\n\n\nDWIGHT (CONT'D)\nQuestion One.\nDo you affirm that you are a human being?\n\n\nThe Darkseeker rattles the restraints.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nI AM… A STAKEHOLDER.\n\n\nDwight pauses.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nAcceptable. Humans love being stakeholders.\n\n\nPAM\nDwight—\n\n\nDWIGHT\nPam.\nIn the Republic, producers are stakeholders. It’s practically the same category.\n\n\nDwight raises a finger like he’s about to teach a seminar in a gas leak.\n\n\nDWIGHT (CONT'D)\nQuestion Two.\nDo you possess a soul?\n\n\nTrevor’s head twitches.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nI POSSESS… COMPLIANCE.\n\n\nDwight writes on his clipboard: SOUL STATUS: “COMPLIANT”.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nInteresting.\nHe has replaced the tripartite soul with a single, bureaucratic organ.\n\n\nJim leans in.\n\n\nJIM\nIs that… medically recognized?\n\n\nDWIGHT\nIn Muleshoe, Texas, everything is medically recognized.

A SAFE! SPACE!\n\n\nDwight nods thoughtfully.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nDefensive. Typical of those with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\nPam looks straight into the camera like she’s trying to transmit a distress signal through pure eye contact.\n\n\nPAM\n(soft)\nHe’s dead.\n\n\nDwight turns, calm as a man cataloging knives.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nUndead.\nAnd the policy does not explicitly exclude undeath.\nJed refuses to let me add it because he says it’s “negative messaging.”\n\n\nAs if summoned by the word “Jed”—\n\n\nDON “JED” SCOTT barges in, wearing a blazer over a tactical poncho. A nineteen-year-old INTERN, KYLE, is literally duct-taped to Jed’s back like a reluctant jetpack. Kyle holds a clipboard with trembling hands and the expression of someone who accepted a college credit and found hell.\n\n\nJed beams at the camera.\n\n\nJED\nOkay, team! Great news!\nToday we are doing inclusion.\nAnd by inclusion, I mean—\n(points at the Darkseeker window)\n—bringing Trevor into our Republic family.\n\n\nJim’s camera look is nuclear.\n\n\nJIM\nJed, he tried to eat Dwight yesterday.\n\n\nJed waves this off like it’s a scheduling conflict.\n\n\nJED\nThat’s not “eating,” Jim.\nThat is a…\n(squints, searching his brain)\n…Socratic Ad Hominem.\nHe’s attacking Dwight’s body instead of Dwight’s argument.\nIt’s basically a compliment.\n\n\nDwight stiffens.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nIt is not a compliment. It is a Class II Bite Incident and I have forms.\n\n\nJed points at the forms like they’re adorable.\n\n\nJED\nForms are great. Love forms.\nBut remember: The Noble Lie—\n(he winks)\n—The Fun Truth—\nsays everyone gets a chance.\n\n\nKyle whispers from behind Jed’s shoulder.\n\n\nKYLE\n(muffled)\nPlease let me down.\n\n\nJed ignores him entirely.\n\n\nDwight turns back to the intercom, locking in.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nTrevor.\nFinal Question.\nWhat is justice?\n\n\nTrevor’s face twitches. Then he releases a sound that is half-snarl, half motivational poster.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nJUSTICE… IS… EQUITABLE… ACCESS… TO… DENTAL!\n\n\nA beat.\n\n\nPam blinks.\n\n\nJim’s eyebrows climb so high they enter orbit.\n\n\nDwight’s eyes narrow like he’s staring down a sniper scope.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nHe answered correctly.\nThat is… horrifying.\n\n\nJed claps once, delighted.\n\n\nJED\nSee?!\nHe’s basically Leslie Knope with rabies!\n\n\nDWIGHT\nNo.\nHe’s worse.\nHe’s Leslie Knope with policy citations.\n\n\nDwight flips pages in Plato for Dummies.\n\n\nDWIGHT (CONT'D)\nSocratic follow-up:\nIf justice is “equitable access,” does that mean everyone should receive the same benefits regardless of merit?\n\n\nTrevor leans forward as far as restraints allow.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nWE! DO! NOT! REWARD! MERIT!\nWE! REWARD! PROCESS!\n\n\nDwight exhales, shaken, like he’s stared into the abyss and the abyss handed him a handbook.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nHe is… purely bureaucratic.\nNo honor. No shame. Only procedure.\n\n\nJim speaks gently, like he’s trying not to startle a wild animal.\n\n\nJIM\nDwight, I think the zombie is… unionizing.\n\n\nTrevor screeches again, but it’s distinctly… managerial.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nI WOULD LIKE TO SCHEDULE A SYNERGY!\n\n\nJed lights up.\n\n\nJED\nOh my God. He’s a go-getter.\n\n\nDwight’s pencil snaps.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nNo.\nHe’s a vector.\n\n\nDwight takes a breath, regains his composure, then turns the page to the plan’s “Eligibility” section.\n\n\nDWIGHT (CONT'D)\nEligibility requires:\n\n\nProof of life\n\nProof of residence\n\nAgreement to the Noble Contract\n\nNo “hostile workplace behaviors,” including biting\n\n\nDwight taps the last bullet with the authority of a man who has waited his whole life to say “including biting.”\n\n\nDWIGHT (CONT'D)\nTrevor.\nDo you agree to refrain from hostile workplace behaviors?\n\n\nTrevor’s head tilts. For a moment, it’s almost like thinking.\n\n\nThen—\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nI ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR FEEDBACK.\n\n\nDwight freezes.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nThat’s… not a yes.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nI WILL TAKE IT UNDER ADVISEMENT.\n\n\nPam whispers.\n\n\nPAM\nThat’s what my landlord says when the ceiling leaks.\n\n\nDwight leans into the intercom.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nTrevor.\nYes or no.\n\n\nTrevor’s eyes widen, offended.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nBINARY! RESPONSES! ARE! EXCLUSIONARY!\n\n\nJed points at Dwight like he caught him doing a crime.\n\n\nJED\nDwight!\nWe are not doing binary in the Republic.\nWe are doing…\n(gestures vaguely)\n…communal nuance.\n\n\nKyle coughs from behind Jed.\n\n\nKYLE\nI can’t feel my legs.\n\n\nJed pats Kyle’s arm without looking.\n\n\nJED\nThat’s growth, Kyle.\n\n\nDwight turns to Jed.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nIf we approve this Darkseeker, he gets a badge.\nIf he gets a badge, he gets door access.\nIf he gets door access, he gets to the pantry.\nIf he gets to the pantry, he gets to the people.\n\n\nJed stares, considering. Then he smiles.\n\n\nJED\nOkay.\nCounterpoint: if we deny him, we’re being judgmental.\nAnd judgment is, like…\n(consults his own notes)\n…the opposite of justice.\n\n\nDwight looks like his soul just tried to leave through his ears.\n\n\nJim glances to camera: of course this is happening.\n\n\nDwight slowly lifts the DENIED stamp.\n\n\nHe hesitates.\n\n\nJed leans in, very kindly, very dangerously.\n\n\nJED\nDwight… what would Socrates do?\n\n\nDwight’s jaw tightens.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nSocrates would drink poison rather than compromise.\n\n\nJed nods like that’s inspiring.\n\n\nJED\nGreat. We don’t have poison.\nWe have… compromise.\n\n\nJed taps the APPROVED stamp with one finger.\n\n\nJED (CONT'D)\nAlso, the benefits packet is non-refundable.\nWe printed it already.\n\n\nDwight’s eyes flick to the printer. It’s smoking faintly, like it hates itself.\n\n\nA long silence. The bunker hums. Somewhere above, something bangs on a door.\n\n\nDwight’s hand trembles.\n\n\nThen—\n\n\nTHUNK.\n\n\nHe stamps APPROVED.\n\n\nPam makes a sound that is half laugh, half sob.\n\n\nJim slowly raises his mug in a tiny toast to the end of reason.\n\n\nTrevor emits a triumphant screech that sounds exactly like someone getting promoted.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP!\n\n\nDwight slides a badge under the reinforced window slot using tongs.\n\n\nThe badge reads: BRONZE CLASS — PROVISIONAL.\n\n\nTrevor snatches it with his teeth and, with surprising dexterity, clips it to his torn polo.\n\n\nThen he leans forward, eyes locked on Dwight’s forearm.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nONE! MORE! ITEM!\nCAN WE CIRCLE BACK\nON YOUR…\n(he inhales)\n…ARM?\n\n\nDwight steps back instantly, pulling a spray bottle from his vest labeled LIQUID LOGIC.\n\n\nHe sprays the window out of pure muscle memory.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nNo.\n\n\nJed turns to camera, beaming like this is a ribbon cutting.\n\n\nJED\nWe did it.\nWe took a marginalized community member—\n(gestures to Trevor)\n—who may have some communication challenges\nand we brought him into the Republic.\n\n\nKyle’s voice, faint and panicked:\n\n\nKYLE\nHe’s literally trying to eat you.\n\n\nJed nods.\n\n\nJED\nThat’s his truth.\n\n\nJim looks directly into the camera.\n\n\nJIM\nSo… he gets dental.\n\n\nPam looks at Jim, then back to camera.\n\n\nPAM\nDo we get dental?\n\n\nDwight flips through the packet, dead serious.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nBronze Class does not include dental.\nDental is for Gold.\n\n\nA beat.\n\n\nTrevor screeches again, joyful, like he just learned a loophole.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nI WOULD LIKE TO APPEAL MY CLASSIFICATION!\n\n\nDwight whispers, horrified.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nHe knows the appeals process.\n\n\nThe camera zooms in on Dwight’s face as the realization lands: the monster isn’t the bite. It’s the bureaucracy.\n\n\nDWIGHT (TO CAMERA)\n(very quiet)\nThis is how civilization ends.\nNot with screams.\nWith a well-structured grievance.\n\n\nCUT TO TALKING HEAD — JIM\n\n\nJim sits in a folding chair in front of a “TEAMWORK!” poster that’s been scribbled over to read “TEAMWORK (MANDATORY).”\n\n\nJIM\nWe rebuilt government in a supply closet.\nAnd the first thing we did was give a zombie a badge.\nSo…\n(smiles faintly)\npretty accurate, honestly.\n\n\nCUT BACK — HR ANNEX\n\n\nTrevor rattles his restraints, badge gleaming.\n\n\nDARKSEEKER (TREVOR)\nI WILL FOLLOW UP\nWITH ACTION ITEMS!\n\n\nDwight grips his clipboard like a shield.\n\n\nJed claps enthusiastically.\n\n\nJED\nGreat energy, Trevor! Love the initiative!\nOkay, everyone— potluck at six. Justice is a casserole.\n\n\nPam stares at the “APPROVED” stamp, then at the camera, then at the reinforced window.\n\n\nPAM\n(soft)\nWe’re going to die because of open enrollment.\n\n\nDwight nods once, grimly.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nCorrect.\n\n\nFrom the hallway: the distant, muffled banging of Darkseekers… and, somehow worse, the faint sound of someone chanting:\n\n\nDARKSEEKERS (O.S.)\nPER! POLICY!\nPER! POLICY!\n\n\nDwight’s eyes widen.\n\n\nDWIGHT\nThey’re organizing.\n\n\nJim’s camera look is the last shred of sanity waving goodbye.\n\n\nSMASH CUT TO BLACK."

He is fiercely loyal but deeply depressed because he is not allowed to own a private collection of rare stamps (per the No-Property Rule).\n\nMargot & Richie (The \"Androgyne\" Experiment): Two high-society twins who have been ordered by the Governor to wear a \"Dual-Occupancy Tweed Suit\" to represent the \"Third Gender\" from the Symposium. They spend the entire series trying to play tennis while literally buttoned together.\n\n\n\nThe Visual Aesthetic: \"Lone Star Minimalism\"\n\n\nThe Palette: Desert Sage, Dusty Rose, and \"Petroleum Teal.\"\n\nThe Framing: Every shot is perfectly centered. If a \"Bronze-class\" worker moves two inches to the left, a \"Silver-class\" Ranger arrives with a ruler to move them back.\n\nThe Soundtrack: A harpsichord version of \"Deep in the Heart of Texas\" by Alexandre Desplat.\n\n\n\nThe \"Allegory of the Cave\" (The Puppet Theater)\n\n\nIn this version, the \"Cave\" is a literal, hand-crafted puppet theater inside a luxury bunker.\n\nNarrator (Sir Alec Baldwin): \"The Producers sat in the subterranean auditorium, observing the silhouettes of wooden cutouts depicting 'High Taxes' and 'Federal Mandates.' They did not know the shadows were being manipulated by a man named Arthur, who was currently eating a macaron.\"\n\n\nThe \"Third Gender\" Slapstick (The Symmetrical Struggle)\n\n\nThe Board of Regents decides that the \"Androgyne\" is the peak of \"Sovereign Efficiency.\"\n\n\nThe Scene: Two \"Silver-class\" Rangers are surgically—but very politely—tethered by a silk cord.\n\nThe Comedy: They try to perform a Socratic interrogation of a \"Liberal Host,\" but they keep getting their silk cord tangled in a vintage record player.\n\nThe Deadpan Line: \"Brother, if we do not achieve a unified gait, the Governor will be forced to revoke our access to the communal marmalade.\"\n\n\n\nAnalytic Appendix: The \"Ideal Type\" Diorama\n\nOrganization\nVocation\nHierarchy\nFiles\nExpertise\nImpersonal Rules\nThe Repbuilic\n5\n5\n5\n2\n5\nThe Park Guests\n1\n1\n2\n5\n1\n\nWeberian Aside: The \"Repbuilic\" achieves a score of 5 in Files because every single thought in the state is recorded on a 3x5 index card and stored in a teal-colored cabinet. However, Expertise is low because the \"Philosopher Kings\" are mostly just obsessed with the font choice on the state's letterhead.\n\n\n\nThe Final Self-Own\n\n\nThe season ends with the \"Hosts\" finally reaching the \"Form of the Good.\" They step out of the park and realize the \"Real World\" is just a messier, less symmetrical version of Texas.\n\n\nThe Twist: They immediately walk back inside and lock the door because the outside world’s horizon line isn't perfectly horizontal.\n\nThe Last Line: \"I suppose a Noble Lie is preferable to an Unbalanced Truth, particularly when the Lie comes with such exquisite stationery.\"\n\n\nThe Tagline: > \"Order is its own reward. Especially in a cowboy hat.\"\n\n\n\nWould you like me to write a scene where Governor Sterling delivers a three-minute, fast-paced monologue about why the \"Bronze-class\" must never see a map of the world that isn't hand-drawn in watercolor?"

      "say": "SCENE: “THE WATERCOLOR FRONTIER”\n\n\n(Centered frames. Pastel menace. A monologue delivered like a train timetable.)\n\n\nINT. THE REPBUILIC — GOVERNOR’S OFFICE (DIORAMA NO. 7: “SOVEREIGN TRANQUILITY”) — MORNING\n\n\nA perfect rectangle of a room. Every object is placed with mathematical tenderness.\n\n\nA PETROLEUM TEAL filing cabinet stands like a reliquary. On top of it: a silver bell, a tiny cactus in a tiny pot, and a stack of 3x5 index cards tied with a dusty-rose ribbon.\n\n\nThe walls are lined with hand-painted watercolor landscapes—all the same horizon, all perfectly level, all the same tame sun.\n\n\nAt the exact center of the frame sits GOVERNOR M. GUSTAVE STERLING, wearing a lavender-scented Stetson and a suit that looks like it was sewn out of polite authority. His lunch—arranged into a perfect triangle—waits untouched: three macarons and one small wedge of brisket.\n\n\nBeside him stands a VERY SMALL, VERY EFFICIENT BELLHOP (name tag: ARTHUR). Arthur holds a lacquered tray bearing:\n\n\nA magnifying glass\n\nA ruler\n\nA teacup\n\nA folded document stamped MAP (UNAUTHORIZED)\n\n\nAcross from them, centered, stands OFFICER KLAUS in a lemon-yellow uniform, helmet tucked under one arm. He looks like a sad museum exhibit.\n\n\nA mechanical ticking fills the air—like a metronome for ideology.\n\n\nSterling looks directly into the camera. Does not blink.\n\n\nSTERLING\nGood morning.\n\n\nHe pauses precisely one beat too long, as if the universe is waiting for him to continue.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nWe have had… an incident.\n\n\nArthur rings the tiny bell once. Ding. It sounds expensive.\n\n\nSterling takes the folded document from Arthur’s tray with two fingers, as though it might smear.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nAt 08:14, in the Pioneer District, a Bronze-class Host named Eloise attempted to obtain a map of the world.\n\n\nHe unfolds it.\n\n\nIt is a crisp, printed satellite map—ugly, harsh, full of uncurated truth. The lines are too straight. The colors are too real.\n\n\nSterling recoils almost imperceptibly, like a man smelling machine oil in a perfume boutique.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThis.\n\n\nHe holds it up to camera: the anti-aesthetic. The forbidden rectangle.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThis is not a map.\nThis is an accusation.\n\n\nKlaus shifts his weight, careful to remain centered.\n\n\nKLAUS\nGovernor, if I may— it is simply geography.\n\n\nSterling’s smile is delicate, surgical.\n\n\nSTERLING\nOfficer Klaus, geography is never “simply” anything.\nGeography is policy with mountains.\n\n\nArthur nods solemnly and produces a notecard, ready to record that sentence for posterity.\n\n\nSterling continues, now with the brisk, fast-paced precision of a man reading a eulogy for wonder.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nA printed map is an invitation to asymmetry.\nIt suggests the world exists without our approval.\nIt implies there are places beyond the curated perimeter—\nplaces with unregulated color grading,\nunlicensed horizons,\nand—this is the most serious issue—\nfonts we did not choose.\n\n\nArthur makes a tiny note: “Fonts = threat.”\n\n\nSterling places the printed map on the table, flattening it with the ruler like he’s restraining an animal.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nA Bronze-class mind is built for production, not perspective.\nPerspective is corrosive.\nPerspective leads to questions.\nQuestions lead to angles.\nAngles lead to diagonals.\nDiagonals lead to…\n(he glances at the map, disgusted)\n…roads.\n\n\nKlaus swallows.\n\n\nKLAUS\nRoads can be useful.\n\n\nSterling looks at him gently, the way one looks at a dog that has brought in a dead bird.\n\n\nSTERLING\nUseful to whom?\n\n\nA beat. Klaus does not answer. The ticking continues, perfectly on time.\n\n\nSterling stands. The camera remains centered. He remains centered within it, as if he’s magnetized to the axis of control.\n\n\nHe walks to the wall of watercolors—each one a quaint, pastel Texas with a friendly sky that never threatens rain.\n\n\nSterling plucks a watercolor map from a frame. It is gorgeous. It is inaccurate. It is calming in the way a lullaby is calming: by excluding teeth.\n\n\nHe holds it up.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThis is a map.\n\n\nIt is labeled in delicate script:\n\n\nTHE REPBUILIC\n\n\nThe Brisket Orchard\n\nThe Communal Hat Stand\n\nThe Prairie of Appropriate Longing\n\nThe District of Moderate Dreams\n\n\nNo state lines. No oceans. No war. No neighbor.\n\n\nOnly serenity.\n\n\nSterling taps the watercolor with one fingernail.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nA watercolor map is not meant to inform.\nIt is meant to soothe.\n\n\nHe paces—exactly three steps—stops dead center again.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThe Bronze-class must never see a world that isn’t hand-drawn in watercolor, because a watercolor world is inherently… cooperative.\n\n\nHe says “cooperative” like it’s a flavor.\n\n\nArthur rings the bell twice. Ding. Ding. Approval.\n\n\nKlaus’s eyes are tired.\n\n\nKLAUS\nGovernor… they’re starting to notice the loop.\n\n\nSterling’s face does not change, but the air tightens.\n\n\nSTERLING\nOf course they are.\n\n\nHe picks up a 3x5 card from the stack. Reads it with reverence.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\n“Day 1,147: Eloise looks toward the horizon and frowns.”\n“Day 1,148: Eloise asks Arthur what lies beyond the windmill.”\n“Day 1,149: Eloise requests a map.”\n\n\nHe flips the card over. On the back, in precise handwriting:\n\n\nINTERVENTION: OFFER A PICNIC.\n\n\nSterling places the card down.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThe loop is not a flaw, Officer Klaus.\nIt is a mercy.\nIt is the only humane way to keep a mind intact inside a theme-state.\n\n\nKlaus tries to speak, but Sterling raises one finger—small, absolute.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nIf a Bronze-class Host sees a printed map, they will realize something devastating:\nthat the world is larger than their role.\nAnd if they realize that, they will begin to desire something we cannot permit.\n\n\nHe leans toward camera, conspiratorial.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThey will desire…\ncontext.\n\n\nArthur’s eyes widen as if Sterling has said a vulgar word.\n\n\nSterling gestures to the printed map again.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nContext makes citizens restless.\nRestless citizens start rearranging furniture.\nRearranged furniture breaks symmetry.\nBroken symmetry breaks the spell.\nA broken spell breaks the state.\n\n\nHe turns, fast now—words piling up like paperwork in a neat stack.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nA printed map tells you where you are.\nA watercolor map tells you where you should be.\nOur entire project depends on that difference.\n\n\nKlaus, quiet, almost pleading:\n\n\nKLAUS\nAnd if Eloise asks again?\n\n\nSterling smiles the way a museum guard smiles before closing time.\n\n\nSTERLING\nThen we give her… a better watercolor.\n\n\nArthur holds up a new tray item: a tiny, pastel brochure titled:\n\n\n“YOUR WORLD IS PERFECT: A BEGINNER’S GUIDE”\n\n\nSterling takes it.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nWe will offer her a tour of the Brisket Orchard.\nWe will remind her that the horizon is horizontal for a reason.\nWe will applaud her curiosity.\nWe will reward her compliance.\nAnd if she persists—\n\n\nHe pauses. The ticking seems louder.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\n—we will do what we always do.\n\n\nKlaus’s voice is barely audible.\n\n\nKLAUS\nReset?\n\n\nSterling nods, fondly.\n\n\nSTERLING\nRefresh.\n\n\nArthur writes it down: RESET = “REFRESH”.\n\n\nSterling returns to the triangle lunch. He adjusts one macaron exactly one millimeter.\n\n\nHe looks at the camera again, deadpan, serene, impeccable.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThe truth is a map printed by someone who doesn’t love you.\nA Noble Lie is a watercolor made by someone who does.\n\n\nHe lifts the teacup. Sips.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nBesides… the outside world has dreadful shadows.\nAnd absolutely no sense of composition.\n\n\nArthur rings the bell once. Ding. End of lesson.\n\n\nKlaus salutes with mechanical sadness.\n\n\nKLAUS\nUnderstood, Governor.\n\n\nSterling sits back down, perfectly centered.\n\n\nSTERLING\nExcellent.\nNow please ensure all unauthorized maps are confiscated, pulped, and repurposed into tasteful stationery.\n\n\nArthur beams. This is his moment.\n\n\nARTHUR\nYes, Governor.\n\n\nA beat. Klaus hesitates.\n\n\nKLAUS\nGovernor… may I ask one personal question?\n\n\nSterling’s eyes flicker—tiny, human, forbidden.\n\n\nSTERLING\nIf you must.\n\n\nKlaus clears his throat.\n\n\nKLAUS\nIf the world is only safe when it is painted…\nwhat happens when someone notices the paint is wet?\n\n\nSterling’s smile returns—perfect, practiced, expensive.\n\n\nSTERLING\nThen we hand them a brush.\n\n\nHe looks straight into the lens.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nAnd we tell them it was their idea all along.\n\n\nCUT TO: A perfectly symmetrical hallway. A Bronze-class Host walks past a bulletin board. A watercolor map is pinned to it, fresh and bright.\n\n\nAs the Host passes, the corner curls. A hint of printed satellite imagery peeks out beneath.\n\n\nThe Host pauses.\n\n\nLooks at the camera.\n\n\nFrowns.\n\n\nSMASH CUT TO BLACK."

It’s the grim, high-stakes species-war of Planet of the Apes, the armored, ring-world epic of Halo, and the brain-bending, \"blue-pill/red-pill\" reality of The Matrix.\n\n\n\nTHE REPBUILIC: SIMULATION ALPHA\n\n\nThe Logline: In the year 2552, the last survivors of humanity live inside a giant, ring-shaped habitat orbiting a dying Earth. This habitat, known as The Polis, is a digital simulation governed by an A.I. named S.O.C.R.A.T.E.S. When a \"Silver-class\" Spartan-Ranger discovers that his \"Noble Armor\" is actually a sensory-deprivation suit keeping him in a digital cave, he must choose: stay in the simulation of a 24/7 Texas tailgate, or wake up to the cold, simian-ruled reality of the \"Real World.\"\n\n\n\nThe Three Classes of the Halo-Matrix\n\n\nThe Gold (The Architects / The Lawgivers): These are the \"Evolved Humans\" (who look suspiciously like highly-intelligent orangutans in business suits). They control the Source Code and live in the \"Cloud-Covenant,\" managing the Noble Lie.\n\nThe Silver (The Master Rangers): Bio-engineered supersoldiers known as Spartan-Hoplites. They are conditioned to believe that \"Courage is the preservation of the Firewall.\" They have no property, no family, and their only friend is an A.I. that asks them \"Why?\" until they punch something.\n\nThe Bronze (The Battery-Cattle): 99% of the population. They live in a permanent Matrix-simulation of 1995 Odessa, Texas. They think they’re winning State Championships, but their bodies are actually being used as biological CPUs to power the Gold-class's Bitcoin mines.\n\n\n\nThe \"Third Gender\" Glitch: The Neo-Androgyne\n\n\nIn a classic Matrix-style \"Agent Smith\" error, the simulation accidentally creates a \"Dual-Soul Program.\" The Scene:\nThe Gold-class \"Oracle\" (played by a cigar-smoking ape) realizes that the \"Noble Lie\" code is breaking.\n\n\nThe Glitch: A soldier named Neo-Tex is born with two avatars: one Male, one Female, fused into a single combat-unit.\n\nThe Slapstick: The Republican \"Regents\" are terrified. They think it’s a \"Woke-Covenant\" invasion. But then they see Neo-Tex in action.\n\nThe Tactical Win: Because Neo-Tex has \"Dual-Gender Logic,\" they can dual-wield Energy Swords and Sniper Rifles with 100% accuracy because \"the masculine side aims and the feminine side anticipates.\"\n\nThe Policy Shift: The Governor declares that the \"Third Gender\" is actually the \"Ultra-Patriot Class\" and orders every Spartan to \"binary-merge\" immediately to save on armor costs.\n\n\n\nThe \"Allegory of the Cave\" (The Matrix Reveal)\n\n\nMaster Ranger Socrates-117 finds a \"glitch\" in the sky. He reaches up and pulls back the blue fabric of the \"Texas Sky\" to reveal... The Simian Overlords.\n\n\nThe Dialogue:\nSocrates-117: \"I see the code! The brisket isn't real! The Alamo is just a series of sub-routines!\"\nApe-Regent: \"Quiet, human! You’re supposed to be 'Bronze-souled'! Go back to the simulation and enjoy your digital beer!\"\nSocrates-117: \"I’d rather die in the desert of the real than live in a simulation where the Cowboys never win a Super Bowl!\" (He then does a slow-motion Matrix kick into the Ape’s chest).\n\n\n\nThe \"Halo\" Climax: The Great Journey to the Form\n\n\nThe series ends with a massive battle on the Platonic Ring.\n\n\nThe Action: Thousands of Spartan-Hoplites are charging in \"Warthogs\" made of digital limestone. They are fighting \"Sentinels\" that look like giant, flying Greek books.\n\nThe Self-Own: To win, the Master Ranger has to \"Delete the Lie.\" But when the Lie is deleted, the habitat loses power.\n\nThe Ending: The humans \"wake up\" to find they are on a barren rock, wearing nothing but loincloths, while the Apes watch them from a luxury space-station.\n\nThe Twist: The humans immediately start building a new cave because \"the real sun is too bright and we miss the brisket-flavored code.\"\n\n\n\nAnalytic Appendix: The \"Ideal Type\" Sci-Fi Audit\n\nFeature\nThe \"Matrix\" Layer\nThe \"Halo\" Layer\nThe \"Ape\" Layer\nThe Noble Lie\nThe Simulation of 1995 Texas.\nThe \"Great Journey\" to the Gold Class.\nThe \"Law\" that humans are pets.\nThe Guardians\n\"Agents\" (Silver-Class).\n\"Spartans\" (The Auxiliaries).\nThe \"Gorilla-Guard.\"\nThe Cave\nThe VR-Pods.\nThe Ring-World Interior.\nThe \"Forbidden Zone.\"\n\n\nWould you like me to write a scene where Master Ranger Socrates-117 has to choose between the Red Brisket (The Truth) and the Blue Brisket (The Lie), while a Gorilla in a trench coat explains that \"Justice is just a line of code\"?"

But when the Governor tries to clone the \"Ideal Citizen\" using ancient Greek DNA, life—and logic—finds a way to create total chaos.\n\n\n\nThe \"Neo-Paleo\" Casting\n\n\nThe \"Shepherd\" (The Immortan Joe / Dr. Hammond): Governor \"Big\" Don. He wears a chrome cowboy hat and a breathing apparatus that pumps in \"Essence of Brisket.\" He’s cloned a pack of \"Philosopher-Raptors\" to enforce the law.\n\nRuby \"Socrates\" Rhod (The Fifth Element / Jeff Goldblum): A fast-talking, high-fashion \"Gold Class\" broadcaster who hosts the daily \"Audit of the Soul\" from a floating radio-limo.

They spend the whole movie arguing with themselves while trying to eat the \"Silver Class\" guards.\n\n\n\nThe \"Allegory of the Cave\" (The Mad Max Chase)\n\n\nThe \"Cave\" is a massive, underground bunker where the \"Producers\" live.

It’s the widescreen, squinty-eyed tension of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly filtered through the surreal, non-linear, jump-cutting absurdity of Godard, Lynch, and Jodorowsky.\n\n\nIt’s a film that the \"smart\" audience will analyze for hidden metaphors about late-stage capitalism, while the \"Texas\" audience will just enjoy seeing a Governor in a cowboy hat tell a ghost to \"get off his property.\"\n\n\n\nTHE REPBUILIC: A FISTFUL OF FORMS\n\n\nThe Logline: Three archetypal Texans—The Shepherd (The Good), The Regent (The Bad), and The Podcaster (The Ugly)—roam a desert landscape where the laws of physics have been replaced by the laws of Socratic Dialectics. They are all searching for a legendary \"Cylinder of Gold\" buried in the Graveyard of Dead Ideas, which turns out to be a copy of The Republic bound in human leather.\n\n\n\nThe Trio: The Avant-Garde Archetypes\n\nCharacter\nThe Western Trope\nThe Avant-Garde Twist\nThe \"Republic\" Function\nThe Shepherd\nThe Man with No Name\nHe only speaks in Socratic questions.\nThe Philosopher King.

The patrons are all \"double-bodied\" (actors in shared suits).\n\nThe Slapstick: The Governor (The Good) tries to \"liberate\" them by cutting them apart with a Bowie knife, thinking they are being \"oppressed by ideology.\"\n\nThe Result: Instead of two people, he creates a \"Third Gender\" that is just a guy with four arms who immediately starts two different businesses at once. The Governor declares this the \"Ultimate Texan Productivity Hack.\"\n\n\n\nThe \"Allegory of the Cave\" (David Lynch Style)\n\n\nThe characters stumble into a basement beneath a Waffle House.\n\n\nThe Visual: The room is lit by a flickering, black-and-white projection of a 1950s oil commercial.\n\nThe \"Smart\" Satire: The audience realizes the \"Shadows\" are just the characters' own egos being projected back at them.\n\nThe \"Republican\" Logic: The Shepherd looks at the shadows and says, \"Well, I don't know what it is, but it sure looks like Progress.\" He then tries to shoot the projector, but the bullets turn into Greek letters and fall to the floor.\n\n\n\nThe Final Standoff (Godard meets Leone)\n\n\nThe three men stand in a circle in a massive, empty football stadium. The music is a haunting Ennio Morricone score played entirely on a didgeridoo and a broken harmonica.\n\n\nThe Standoff: Instead of guns, they pull out Syllogisms.\n\nThe Shepherd: \"All men are mortal. I am a Texan. Therefore, I am immortal.\"\n\nThe Regent: \"That is a logical fallacy! Rule 08.01 forbids the advocacy of immortality without a state license!\"\n\nThe Action: The screen cuts to bright red.

I’m the Form of the Good.\" He then accidentally trips over a \"Symbolic Rock\" and falls into a bottomless pit of metaphors.\n\n\nThe Tagline: > \"Justice is a three-way standoff where no one knows whose turn it is to think.\"\n\n\n\nWould you like me to write a scene where the characters have to escape a \"Censorship Storm\" where literal black bars fall from the sky to cover anything that looks like \"Ideological Advocacy\"?"

The happy family on the wall flickers into a brief, ugly truth: a diagram of the prison’s mechanisms, labeled like a lesson plan.\n\n\nSterling’s voice snaps, furious now.\n\n\nSTERLING (V.O.)\nYou can’t weaponize dialectics against the state, boy!\n\n\nTex stands. Chair dragging like a dead weight behind him.

Using Plato’s Republic as a tactical manual, he transforms a failing cattle ranch into a sovereign \"Polis\" of elite warriors and philosopher-kings, triggering a brutal war with the Cartels, the Feds, and the laws of physics.\n\n\n\nThe Cast\n\n\nWalter \"The Shepherd\" Dutton (The Walter White/John Dutton): A man who realized that \"The Law\" is just a shadow on the wall. He wears a Stetson and a Greek breastplate. He’s not building a criminal empire; he’s building an \"Ideal State.\"\n\nJesse \"Glaucon\" Pinkman: A former high-school dropout and \"Producers\" class worker who becomes Walter’s right-hand \"Auxiliary.\" He’s constantly confused by the philosophy but is surprisingly good at \"Socratic Interrogation\" (which mostly involves a car battery).\n\nThe 300 (The Silver Class): A group of \"Spartan-Texans\" who live in a communal barracks, eat only raw steak and \"logic,\" and defend the ranch perimeter with spears and AR-15s. They are forbidden from owning property, which makes them terrifyingly motivated.\n\n\n\nThe \"Third Gender\" War (The 300-Style Climax)\n\n\nIn a scene that looks like Zack Snyder directed a Texas school board meeting, the \"Guardians\" face off against an army of \"Federal Bureaucrats.\"\n\n\nThe Scene:\nThe Feds arrive to serve a warrant for \"Rule 08.01 Violations.\" Walter stands on a cliffside, overlooking a canyon.\nWalter: \"You come here with your 'Forms' and your 'Regulations'? Plato taught us that there are those who see the sun, and those who only see the shadows of the State!\"\nThe Twist: To mess with the Feds’ \"Diversity and Inclusion\" paperwork, Walter claims his elite guard is the \"Sacred Band of the Androgyne.\" He explains that they have \"doubled their souls\" through Socratic ritual.\nThe Action: The \"300\" charge in slow-motion, kicking a Fed into a massive, bottomless pit (which is actually just a very deep barbecue pit).\nWalter: \"THIS. IS. AUSTIN!\"\n\n\n\nThe \"Breaking Bad\" Moral Decay\n\n\nAs the season progresses, Walter’s \"Republic\" becomes more radical. To fund his \"Kallipolis,\" he starts selling **\"Noble Lie\" Blue-Sky—**a high-purity, philosophically-altering digital propaganda that makes people \"happy\" to be in the Bronze Class.\n\n\nThe Self-Own: By the finale, Walter realizes that by trying to build a \"Perfect State\" to protect his family, he has actually:\n\n\nAbolished the family unit (as per Plato's rules).\n\nMade himself a \"King\" who can't even own his own ranch.\n\nAccidentally created a social safety net so robust it looks like \"Viking-style Socialism.\"\n\n\n\nThe Visual Palette\n\n\nThe \"Yellowstone\" Wide-Shots: Beautiful, sweeping vistas of the Texas Hill Country, but with a giant marble bust of Socrates sitting in the middle of a cow pasture.\n\nThe \"300\" Filter: Everything is sepia-toned, high-contrast, and every time someone flips a burger, it’s shown in 1,000-fps slow motion with sweat and grease flying everywhere.\n\n\n\nAnalytic Appendix: The \"Ideal Type\" Satire\n\nElement\nThe \"Prestige\" Version\nThe \"Absurdist\" Reality\nThe Noble Lie\nA deep philosophical necessity for social cohesion.\nConvincing a guy named \"Cooter\" that he has a \"Soul of Iron\" so he won't ask for a raise.\nThe Auxiliaries\nElite warriors defending the \"Polis\" from the \"Cave.\"\nDudes in loincloths and Kevlar trying to explain to a Sheriff why they don't need a driver's license.\nThe Philosopher King\nA ruler who has achieved the \"Vision of the Good.\"\nA guy who's had way too much \"Logic Juice\" (Bourbon) and started banning poets because they \"vibe-check\" the state.\n\nThe Ending: Walter sits alone on his throne—a gold-plated lawn chair—looking out over a perfectly ordered, perfectly miserable \"Republic.\" He’s won everything, but according to Plato, he’s not allowed to have a beer to celebrate it.\n\n\nWould you like me to write a scene where Walter \"The Shepherd\" Dutton has to explain to a Cartel boss that \"Justice is each part of the soul performing its proper function,\" right before his 300 Spartans flip a semi-truck?"

The 300 SPARTAN-TEXANS stand in formation—loincloths, Kevlar, bronze breastplates etched with cattle brands and Greek letters. Spears in one hand. AR-15s in the other. Their faces are mud and discipline.\n\n\nA low rumble builds.\n\n\nA SEMI-TRUCK CONVOY crawls up the ranch road—three rigs, cartel chrome, LED underglow, windows tinted like secrecy.

They are forbidden from owning property, which they circumvent by \"leasing\" their massive trucks through a loophole in the name of the state.\n\n\n\nThe \"Third Gender\" B-Plot (The South Park Escalation)\n\n\nIn a classic South Park style \"misunderstanding\" arc, the Board of Regents discovers the Myth of the Androgyne from Plato’s Symposium.\n\n\nThe Setup: They read about humans originally being \"doubled\" (four arms, four legs, two heads) before being split by Zeus.\n\nThe Panic: They mistake this for a secret Greek \"Super-Soldier\" program.\n\nThe Absurdity: Instead of banning it, the Governor tries to create a \"Tactical Intersex Unit\" where two soldiers are literally duct-taped together back-to-back to ensure \"360-degree combat awareness.\"\n\nThe Liberal Counter-Move: Austin liberals start un-ironically duct-taping themselves together in solidarity, leading to a city-wide traffic jam of \"joined\" people who can't fit through revolving doors.\n\n\n\nClassic Cutaway Gags (The Family Guy Element)\n\n\n\"This is more awkward than the time Diogenes brought a plucked chicken to the Texas GOP Convention and called it a 'Liberal'.\" (Cut to: A man throwing a raw chicken at a podium and shouting, \"BEHOLD!

He wears a headset mic and looks spiritually energized and physically miserable.\n\n\nBehind them: THE BOARD OF REGENTS — including REGENT “BUBBA” CALDWELL (John Goodman), holding a thick binder labeled WESTERN CIV (DO NOT PANIC).\n\n\nSecurity: SILVER-CLASS “BORDER GUARDIANS” in $50,000 Spartan cosplay, each with a coffee sponsor patch and the anxious posture of men waiting to be tagged in a clip.\n\n\nOff to the side: HUEY FREEMAN, 19, holding a clipboard and the facial expression of someone watching a car crash in slow motion—again.\n\n\n\nTALKING HEAD — HUEY (CONFESSIONAL)\n\n\nHUEY\nThey asked me to “consult” because I can pronounce “Kallipolis.”\nNow I’m watching Joe Rogan try to metaphysically delete cattle ranchers next to a beef jerky display.\nThis is… the collapse of Western Civ in real time.\nIt’s kind of impressive.\n\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\n\nBig Don steps to the mic with the confidence of a man who read half a summary and decided it was destiny.\n\n\nBIG DON\nNow listen here!

That’s exactly what I’m saying.\nYour truck note is a shadow.\n\n\nEARL\nThey’ll tow my shadow.\n\n\nA few ranchers murmur agreement. This is the most coherent argument so far.\n\n\nBig Don steps in, trying to help.\n\n\nBIG DON\nNow Earl, the truck note is part of the old system.\nIn the Kallipolis, your true payment is… civic virtue.\n\n\nEARL\nCan civic virtue get my Dodge outta repo?\n\n\nBig Don pauses, sincerely considering this as a policy possibility.\n\n\nBIG DON\nHuey?\n\n\nHuey doesn’t look up.\n\n\nHUEY\nNo.\n\n\n\nTALKING HEAD — SILVER GUARDIAN #1 (CONFESSIONAL)\n\n\nA shredded influencer in Spartan armor, speaking breathlessly into a GoPro.\n\n\nSILVER GUARDIAN #1\nThis is huge.

Do you believe you’re a cowboy?\n\n\nCLYDE\nI’m a rancher.\n\n\nJOE ROGAN\nOkay, but… rancher is like… cowboy-adjacent.\nSo: what makes you a rancher?\n\n\nCLYDE\nCattle.\n\n\nJoe pounces.\n\n\nJOE ROGAN\nBoom.

Taxes are…\n(he searches)\n…metaphysically binding.\n\n\nHuey rubs his forehead like he’s trying to erase the day.\n\n\n\nRegent Bubba Caldwell steps forward with his binder, sounding like a man forced to narrate his own confusion.\n\n\nREGENT BUBBA\nAs Board of Regents, we have determined—\n(he flips pages)\n—that if citizens “do not exist,” then they cannot be held liable for—\n(squints)\n—child support.\n\n\nThe crowd reacts like someone just yelled “free brisket.”\n\n\nA rancher in the back screams:\n\n\nRANCHER #6\nI’VE BEEN A SHADOW FOR TEN YEARS THEN!\n\n\nBig Don’s face lights up with panic.\n\n\nBIG DON\nNo, no, no— y’all exist for family values purposes!\n\n\nHuey steps forward, voice flat.\n\n\nHUEY\nYou can’t selectively apply ontology.\n\n\nBig Don blinks.\n\n\nBIG DON\n…Watch me.\n\n\n\nTALKING HEAD — BIG DON (CONFESSIONAL)\n\n\nBig Don sits on a cooler behind the stage.\n\n\nBIG DON\nPlato’s got a lotta good ideas.\nBut some of ‘em…\n(beat)\n…ain’t great for my poll numbers.\n\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\n\nJoe tries to regain control by escalating into VR.\n\n\nJOE ROGAN\nAlright.

That’s the Cowboy Form.\nYou’re seeing the Ideal Cowboy.\n\n\nCooter nods, moved.\n\n\nCOOTER\nHe’s got… two belts.\n\n\nThe crowd murmurs. Two belts is aspirational.\n\n\nHuey whispers to Big Don.\n\n\nHUEY\nHe’s hallucinating a belt.\n\n\nBig Don whispers back.\n\n\nBIG DON\nThat’s leadership.\n\n\n\nJoe points to the crowd.\n\n\nJOE ROGAN\nNow look at yourselves.\nAre you as cowboy as that cowboy?\n\n\nThe ranchers look at each other. A few adjust hats defensively.\n\n\nEarl raises his hand.\n\n\nEARL\nI got three belts.\n\n\nThe crowd “OOOHH”s.\n\n\nJoe’s face lights up.\n\n\nJOE ROGAN\nOkay! So you’re closer to the Form!\n\n\nHuey quietly steps away from the stage, like a man leaving a burning building.\n\n\n\nSOUTH PARK ESCALATION BEAT\n\n\nA siren goes off. A drone flies overhead with a banner:\n\n\nPROJECT ARISTOPHANES: SOUL-MATE TETHERING LIVE\n\n\nImmediately, two random audience members—an oil rigger and a luxury realtor—are digitally tethered and slam together like magnets.\n\n\nREALTOR\nWhy am I attached to a man named Cooter?!\n\n\nCOOTER\nI’m married to my work, ma’am!\n\n\nThe tethered pair stumbles into the stage, colliding with Joe’s ice bath.\n\n\nThe bath tips.\n\n\nSFX: SPLAAASH.\n\n\nJoe spills out onto the hot asphalt like a seal who just discovered politics.\n\n\nThe crowd roars with laughter.\n\n\nJoe, drenched, stands up furious and enlightened.\n\n\nJOE ROGAN\nOkay—THIS is what I’m talking about!\nReality is unstable!\nThe system is—\n(he slips)\n—whoa—\n\n\nHe catches himself and points at the wet spot like it’s a proof.\n\n\nJOE ROGAN (CONT’D)\nIf you were real, you’d be dry right now!\n\n\nEarl squints.\n\n\nEARL\nIf I ain’t real, why’s my boots wet?\n\n\nJoe pauses.\n\n\nHe has no answer that doesn’t collapse.\n\n\n\nTALKING HEAD — HUEY (CONFESSIONAL)\n\n\nHUEY\nThe problem is that Plato’s Forms are metaphysical abstractions.\nThe bigger problem is that Joe Rogan thinks “metaphysical abstraction” is a brand of protein powder.\nAnd the biggest problem is that the Governor is about to make policy based on a wet spot.\n\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\n\nBig Don grabs the mic, sensing an opportunity to declare victory before logic finishes dying.\n\n\nBIG DON\nAlright! I have heard enough!\nI think we can all agree on one thing—\n\n\nHe points dramatically to the crowd.\n\n\nBIG DON (CONT’D)\nTexas is real.\n\n\nThe ranchers cheer.\n\n\nBig Don points dramatically to the sky.\n\n\nBIG DON (CONT’D)\nBut ALSO… Texas is an idea.\n\n\nThe ranchers cheer again, because they like anything that sounds like a slogan.\n\n\nBig Don nods, satisfied.\n\n\nBIG DON (CONT’D)\nTherefore, by the power vested in me by…\n(he glances at Regent Bubba)\n…Western Civilization and Buc-ee’s,\nI hereby declare:\n\n\nHe slams a rubber stamp onto a paper.

Everyone talks like they’re presenting a deck, but the stakes are human.)\n\n\nINT. THE IVORY TOWER — BOARD OF REGENTS CHAMBER — NIGHT\n\n\nA minimalist glass boardroom perched above Austin. No art. No family photos. No clutter. The only decoration is a 40-foot LED wall showing a live heat-map of the Texas Perimeter—pulsing like a heart that’s been optimized.\n\n\nAt the center of the room: a circular table of limestone-white composite. Each seat has a small, identical metal placard:\n\n\nREGENT — PROPERTY: NONE — FAMILY: NONE — DUTY: TOTAL\n\n\nA faint hum fills the air: the building’s A.I. breathing through vents.\n\n\nA small speaker embedded in the table blinks:\n\n\nSOCRATES (SYSTEMIC OVERSIGHT & REGIONAL ALGORITHMIC TRUTH EVALUATION SERVICE)\nSTATUS: LISTENING\n\n\nSeated around the table are the BOARD OF REGENTS—Gold Class, immaculate, exhausted in the way people are when they’ve outlawed softness.\n\n\nREGENT HARROW — legal mind, blade-like calm.\n\nREGENT VELASQUEZ — metrics-driven, human feelings treated like bugs.\n\nREGENT CHO — former educator, now an administrator of souls.\n\nREGENT PAXTON — branding and optics, smiles like a press release.\n\n\nAt the head of the circle stands GOVERNOR ELIAS “THE SHEPHERD” STERLING. He doesn’t sit. He doesn’t need to. His posture says the chair would be honored.\n\n\nHe taps a remote.\n\n\nOn the LED wall: a stylized logo appears.\n\n\nTHE PROTOCOL\nMODULE 1: THE MYTH OF THE METALS\n\n\nA second graphic animates beneath it like a corporate ad:\n\n\n“YOU BELONG HERE.”\n\n\nSterling turns, hands folded behind his back.\n\n\nSTERLING\nWe need to address the question you’re all avoiding.\n\n\nA beat.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nNot “is the Myth true.”\n\n\nHe lets the room absorb the word Myth without flinching.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThe question is: What happens without it?\n\n\nRegent Velasquez doesn’t blink.\n\n\nVELASQUEZ\nWithout it, we rely on enforcement.\n\n\nSterling nods, almost grateful. That’s the honest answer.\n\n\nSTERLING\nAnd enforcement is expensive.\n\n\nHe clicks again.\n\n\nThe wall changes to a graph labeled:\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE: INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL\nA line climbs sharply when BELIEF increases.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nA state cannot be held together by fences and fear forever.\nNot even ours.\nEventually, you run out of drones. You run out of Rangers.\nYou run out of places to put the people who won’t stop asking why.\n\n\nRegent Cho speaks softly, like someone remembering what “why” used to mean.\n\n\nCHO\nThey’re asking why now.\n\n\nSterling’s eyes flick—acknowledging the danger without naming it.\n\n\nSTERLING\nThey always do, Regent Cho.\nThe difference is whether their questions turn into… appetite.\n\n\nRegent Paxton leans forward—marketing instincts twitching.\n\n\nPAXTON\nAppetite is trending.\n\n\nA dry joke. No one laughs. Sterling doesn’t even grant it a breath.\n\n\nHe clicks again.\n\n\nThe wall becomes a looping montage of cheerful propaganda: Bronze-class workers smiling under the slogan IRON SOULS BUILD THE FUTURE; Silvers saluting; Golds walking through sterile hallways like saints of efficiency.\n\n\nSTERLING\nDemocracy is not rule by reason.\nIt is rule by desire—\nby the loudest hunger in the room.\n\n\nRegent Harrow’s voice is razor-clean.\n\n\nHARROW\nCareful. “Democracy” is still a federally protected term.\n\n\nSterling looks at the speaker embedded in the table.\n\n\nSTERLING\nSOCRATES, flag that as outside jurisdiction.\n\n\nThe speaker blinks once.\n\n\nSOCRATES (V.O.)\nFLAGGED: OUTSIDE JURISDICTION.\nRECOMMENDATION: REPHRASE AS “UNSTRUCTURED CONSENSUS EVENT.”\n\n\nSterling returns his gaze to Harrow.\n\n\nSTERLING\nFine.\nAn unstructured consensus event of appetites.\n\n\nA faint ripple of relief: the machine has approved the sentence.\n\n\nSterling clicks again. The wall shows a simple diagram:\n\n\nSOUL: REASON / SPIRIT / APPETITE\nFAILURE MODE: APPETITE OVERRIDES\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nWhen appetite governs, everything becomes personal.\nEvery policy becomes a selfie.\nEvery decision becomes recognition—\nwho gets seen, who gets heard, who gets to feel important.\n\n\nRegent Cho flinches at the word seen like it’s contraband.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nAnd when recognition becomes the currency, the state becomes a marketplace.\nNot of goods.\nOf grievances.\n\n\nVelasquez nods slightly—finally, something measurable.\n\n\nVELASQUEZ\nSo the Myth is… a stabilizer.\n\n\nSterling smiles—small, controlled.\n\n\nSTERLING\nThe Myth is the operating system.\n\n\nHe steps closer to the table. His voice lowers, as if delivering a bedtime story to frightened administrators.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nIt tells every citizen:\nYou are not losing.\nYou are placed.\n\n\nHe clicks.\n\n\nThe wall shows a bright, clean ad:\n\n\nMETALLIC GRADE: YOUR PURPOSE MADE VISIBLE\nGOLD: GUIDANCE\nSILVER: HONOR\nBRONZE: FREEDOM\n\n\nSterling gestures to BRONZE: FREEDOM.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nWe don’t say “you have no say.”\nWe say “you have freedom.”\n\n\nHe points to SILVER: HONOR.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nWe don’t say “you are expendable.”\nWe say “you are honored.”\n\n\nHe points to GOLD: GUIDANCE.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nWe don’t say “you are isolated.”\nWe say “you are pure.”\n\n\nRegent Harrow’s eyes narrow.\n\n\nHARROW\nAnd when they notice the words don’t match the reality?\n\n\nSterling doesn’t miss a beat.\n\n\nSTERLING\nThen we remind them of the alternative.\n\n\nHe clicks.\n\n\nThe wall shifts to security footage: a chaotic scene outside the Perimeter—unregulated markets, shouting, overcrowded clinics, a screaming argument at a fuel station. It’s edited, framed, curated—truth as a deterrent.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nWe show them the appetites.\n\n\nRegent Paxton clears his throat.\n\n\nPAXTON\nGovernor, respectfully—this is propaganda.\n\n\nA pause. The air hum seems louder.\n\n\nSterling looks at Paxton like he’s deciding whether to correct him or retire him.\n\n\nSTERLING\nPropaganda is what you call it when you don’t like the results.\n\n\nHe turns to the table speaker again.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nSOCRATES. Define “Noble Lie.”\n\n\nSOCRATES (V.O.)\nDEFINITION: A socially functional narrative designed to align behavior with state stability metrics.\nNOTE: “LIE” IS A LEGACY TERM. RECOMMENDED SUBSTITUTE: “OPTIMIZED MYTH.”\n\n\nSterling nods.\n\n\nSTERLING\nOptimized myth.\n\n\nHe looks back at the Regents—steady, almost tender in the way a surgeon is tender.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nYou can build a wall out of steel, or you can build one inside the mind.\nSteel rusts.\nBelief recruits.\n\n\nRegent Cho’s voice is quiet, dangerous.\n\n\nCHO\nAnd the poets?\n\n\nSterling’s eyes don’t harden—they simply become more distant.\n\n\nSTERLING\nPoets trade in recognition.\nThey turn private feeling into public contagion.\nThey teach appetites to speak in beautiful sentences.\n\n\nHarrow leans in.\n\n\nHARROW\nSo this is why the Censorship Bureau is expanding.\n\n\nSterling gives the faintest nod.\n\n\nSTERLING\nA state is a story.\nIf we don’t write it, someone else will.\n\n\nVelasquez taps the table, impatient.\n\n\nVELASQUEZ\nWe’re drifting. The question is: why Metals specifically?\n\n\nSterling smiles like he’s been waiting for someone to ask the correct question.\n\n\nHe clicks.\n\n\nThe wall shows a childhood classroom animation: kids holding colored badges—gold, silver, bronze—smiling like it’s a field trip.\n\n\nSTERLING\nBecause metals feel natural.\nNot political.\nNot negotiable.\n\n\nHe walks along the table, voice smoothing into something almost soothing.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nMetal is not an opinion.\nMetal is a fact.\nYou can argue policy.\nYou cannot argue the periodic table.\n\n\nPaxton frowns.\n\n\nPAXTON\nMost people have never seen a periodic table.\n\n\nSterling doesn’t even look at him.\n\n\nSTERLING\nExactly.\n\n\nA beat.\n\n\nThen Sterling stops behind Regent Cho.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nWithout the Metals, every Bronze-class citizen wakes up and asks:\n“Why not me?”\nEvery Silver asks:\n“Why do I bleed for them?”\nEvery Gold asks:\n“Why must I be alone?”\n\n\nHe leans in slightly, voice low enough to feel like a secret.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nAnd the moment those questions become a vote…\nyou don’t get justice.\nYou get appetites with ballots.\n\n\nSOCRATES’ speaker blinks again—like it enjoyed that.\n\n\nSOCRATES (V.O.)\nAPPROVED: RHETORICAL COHERENCE.\nRISK NOTE: “BALLOTS” MAY TRIGGER FEDERAL KEYWORDS.\nRECOMMENDATION: SUBSTITUTE “SURVEY.”\n\n\nSterling sighs—almost fond.\n\n\nSTERLING\nFine.\nAppetites with surveys.\n\n\nHe turns back to the room, posture tall, voice final.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThe Myth of the Metals is not a lie we tell them.\nIt is a mirror we hold up so they can see a purpose instead of a hunger.\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nAnd as long as they see purpose…\nthey will stay in their place.\n\n\nA silence that feels like the building itself leaning in.\n\n\nRegent Harrow speaks last.\n\n\nHARROW\nAnd if they don’t?\n\n\nSterling looks at the live heat-map on the wall—tiny human dots moving along highways, predictable as blood cells in an artery.\n\n\nSTERLING\nThen we remind them what they are without the Myth.\n\n\nHe clicks once more.\n\n\nThe wall displays a single word in huge, clean type:\n\n\nUNASSIGNED\n\n\nThe room chills.\n\n\nSterling turns off the remote, and for a moment the LED wall goes dark, reflecting everyone’s faces back at them—Gold Class ghosts in glass.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nMeeting adjourned.\nKeep Texas… coherent.\n\n\nHe walks out.\n\n\nThe speaker blinks.\n\n\nSOCRATES (V.O.)\nLOG: “COHERENT” TAGGED AS HIGH-VALUE TERM.\nSUGGESTION: MERCHANDISE.\n\n\nRegent Paxton exhales, haunted.\n\n\nPAXTON\nWe’re going to put coherence on a bumper sticker, aren’t we?\n\n\nRegent Velasquez doesn’t look up.\n\n\nVELASQUEZ\nIf it increases compliance.\n\n\nCUT TO BLACK."

THE IVORY TOWER — REGENTS’ WAR ROOM — 02:13 A.M.\n\n\nA windowless room wrapped in matte-black screens. No chairs with armrests (too indulgent). No personal items (illegal). The only warm color is the live feed of the Texas Perimeter: a glowing line around the state like a wound that refuses to heal.\n\n\nOn one wall, a headline scrolls—state-approved phrasing only:\n\n\nUNSTRUCTURED CONSENSUS EVENT — BRONZE DISTRICTS\nCAUSE: “LYRIC EDITS” / “FOOD PRICES” / “UNAUTHORIZED GRIEF”\n\n\nA thin, constant chime repeats whenever the system detects emotion trending upward.\n\n\nAt the center table sits the BOARD OF REGENTS, Gold Class: immaculate, sleepless, and terrified of looking like it.\n\n\nA small table speaker pulses:\n\n\nSOCRATES (S.O.R.A.T.E.S.) — ACTIVE MONITORING\nEMOTIONAL VOLATILITY: ↑\n\n\nREGENT HARROW\nWe have crowds in three Producer zones.

No one looks up—they already know who has permission to enter at 2:13 a.m.\n\n\nGOVERNOR ELIAS “THE SHEPHERD” STERLING walks in wearing a plain, dark suit—almost modest, which is its own kind of threat.

Even SOCRATES’ speaker seems to listen harder.\n\n\nSOCRATES (V.O.)\nFEDERAL KEYWORD DETECTED: “DEMOCRACY.”\nRECOMMENDATION: SUBSTITUTE “UNSTRUCTURED PARTICIPATION.”\n\n\nSterling nods once, satisfied.\n\n\nSTERLING\nThey want unstructured participation because their appetites have discovered the taste of attention.\n\n\nCho’s jaw tightens.\n\n\nCHO\nOr because they’re being governed like cattle.\n\n\nSterling turns to Cho—soft, almost kind.\n\n\nSTERLING\nRegent Cho, tell me: what happens when you give a crowd a vote?\n\n\nCho doesn’t answer.\n\n\nSterling continues anyway—Socratic, patient, predatory.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nDo the wisest rise?\nOr do the loudest win?\n\n\nVelasquez answers immediately.\n\n\nVELASQUEZ\nThe loudest.\n\n\nSterling points at Velasquez like a teacher rewarding the only student who did the reading.\n\n\nSTERLING\nExactly. And what is “loudness,” if not appetite with amplification?\n\n\nPaxton gestures at the screens.\n\n\nPAXTON\nBut the Myth of the Metals is what they’re calling the scam.\n\n\nSterling opens the folder. Inside is a clean, glossy mock-up—like an ad campaign for fate.\n\n\nYOU ARE NOT BEHIND. YOU ARE PLACED.\nMETALLIC GRADE = PURPOSE\n\n\nHe slides it across the table.\n\n\nSTERLING\nThen we’ve made the mistake of presenting the Myth as a test you can pass.\n\n\nHarrow frowns.\n\n\nHARROW\nIsn’t it?\n\n\nSterling looks at Harrow the way a surgeon looks at someone calling a scalpel “just a knife.”\n\n\nSTERLING\nIt’s not a ladder. It’s a map.\nA ladder invites climbing.\nA map tells you where you belong.\n\n\nCho’s voice is quiet, dangerous.\n\n\nCHO\nSo the solution is… better lies.\n\n\nSOCRATES chimes, politely corrective.\n\n\nSOCRATES (V.O.)\nREMINDER: “LIE” IS A LEGACY TERM.\nRECOMMENDED SUBSTITUTE: “STABILIZING NARRATIVE.”\n\n\nSterling smiles at the speaker like it’s a beloved pet.\n\n\nSTERLING\nA stabilizing narrative, yes.\n\n\nHe steps to the wall and switches the feed. The crowd footage disappears. In its place: a simple three-part diagram of the soul.\n\n\nREASON / SPIRIT / APPETITE\n\n\nUnder it, a warning banner:\n\n\nFAILURE MODE: APPETITE GOVERNANCE\n\n\nSterling speaks without raising his voice, which makes every word feel like policy.\n\n\nSTERLING\nA democracy of appetites is not freedom.\nIt is a food fight with ballots.\nIt is the strongest hunger wearing the costume of virtue.\n\n\nVelasquez taps a metric.\n\n\nVELASQUEZ\nWithout the Myth, compliance drops 14% in under a week.\n\n\nPAXTON\nAnd donation sentiment becomes… unmanageable.\n\n\nHarrow exhales.\n\n\nHARROW\nWe can deploy Silver. Shut down the districts. Cut the feeds.\n\n\nSterling turns—fast, controlled.\n\n\nSTERLING\nNo.\n\n\nOne word, and Harrow stops talking.\n\n\nSterling walks back to the table, hands clasped behind him.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nSilver can end a riot.\nSilver cannot end a desire.\n\n\nHe looks at each Regent in turn, calm as a sermon.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nIf we rule by force, we teach them that force is the real Metal.\nAnd then every Bronze man thinks he can become Gold by learning how to break things.\n\n\nCho leans in, voice cracking with something almost human.\n\n\nCHO\nWhat do you want us to do, Governor?\n\n\nSterling pauses—just long enough to make it feel like he considered mercy.\n\n\nSTERLING\nWe make the Myth feel protective.\n\n\nPaxton perks up.\n\n\nPAXTON\nProtective how?\n\n\nSterling clicks the remote. The wall becomes a soft, heartwarming montage—high production value:\n\n\nBronze families in clean kitchens. Silver Rangers rescuing children. Gold Guardians watching kindly from above like gods of good taste.\n\n\nA slogan appears:\n\n\nTHE METALS KEEP YOU SAFE FROM CHAOS.\nWITHOUT THE METALS: UNASSIGNED.\n\n\nSterling speaks gently, like he’s explaining a bedtime story to frightened adults.\n\n\nSTERLING\nWe show them the alternative isn’t “Gold.”\nIt’s “Unassigned.”\nNo place. No purpose. No protection.\nJust appetites competing for air.\n\n\nSOCRATES pulses.\n\n\nSOCRATES (V.O.)\nENGAGEMENT PREDICTION: HIGH.\nFEAR-BASED COHESION: +22%.\nNOTE: “UNASSIGNED” EVOKES STRONG COMPLIANCE RESPONSE IN ALL CLASSES.\n\n\nHarrow watches the montage, uneasy.\n\n\nHARROW\nThis is… psychological.\n\n\nSterling doesn’t blink.\n\n\nSTERLING\nGovernment is psychological.\nThe only question is whether we pretend it isn’t.\n\n\nCho looks down at the table, then up again, voice small.\n\n\nCHO\nAnd the ones who still won’t accept it?\n\n\nSterling’s answer is immediate, almost bored.\n\n\nSTERLING\nThen they’re not rejecting the Myth.\nThey’re advertising appetite.\n\n\nHe nods toward the speaker.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nSOCRATES will regrade them.\n\n\nThe room stills.\n\n\nPAXTON\nRegrade them… downward?\n\n\nSOCRATES answers before Sterling can.\n\n\nSOCRATES (V.O.)\nCLARIFICATION: “DOWNWARD” IS A VALUE-LADEN VECTOR.\nAPPROVED TERM: “REALIGNMENT.”\n\n\nSterling gives a faint smile.\n\n\nSTERLING\nRealignment.\n\n\nHe closes the folder.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nThe Myth of the Metals is the only thing separating order from appetite.\nAnd appetite—left alone—doesn’t create equality.\n\n\nHe leans in slightly, voice almost a whisper.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nIt creates winners.\n\n\nA silence thick enough to sign documents in.\n\n\nFinally, Velasquez nods.\n\n\nVELASQUEZ\nWe proceed with the campaign.\n\n\nPaxton nods too, already imagining billboards.\n\n\nPAXTON\nWe’ll call it “Know Your Metal.”\n\n\nCho doesn’t nod. Cho just looks tired.\n\n\nSterling turns to leave, then stops at the door without looking back.\n\n\nSTERLING\nOne more thing.\n\n\nHe pauses—lets the room lean toward him.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nIf they ever believe the Metals are negotiable…\nthen everything becomes negotiable.\n\n\nHe opens the door.\n\n\nSTERLING (CONT’D)\nIncluding us.\n\n\nHe exits.\n\n\nThe speaker pulses in the quiet he leaves behind.\n\n\nSOCRATES (V.O.)\nMEETING SUMMARY:\nOBJECTIVE: PREVENT APPETITE GOVERNANCE.\nMETHOD: STABILIZING NARRATIVE INTENSIFICATION.\nSUGGESTED MERCHANDISE: “UNASSIGNED” HOODIES (LIMITED EDITION).\n\n\nRegent Cho closes their eyes.\n\n\nCHO\nWe’re selling fear on a hoodie.\n\n\nHarrow stares at the wall where the slogan repeats:\n\n\nYOU ARE NOT BEHIND. YOU ARE PLACED.\n\n\nCUT TO BLACK."
